# Introduction

Alumette (match in French, as in *a tiny torch*) is a tiny neural networks library with a reverse-mode autodiff engine based on Karpathy's
micrograd. It aims to be a little bit more usable through the use of tensors and GPU acceleration.

**Why?** Because it feels so good to understand how Pytorch really works! And it's super fun to
code ;)

# TODO:

- [x] Build autograd on scalars
- [x] Build small neural network library
- [x] Write neural net example
